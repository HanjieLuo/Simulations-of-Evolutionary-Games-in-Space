# Simulations-of-Evolutionary-Games-in-Space
Evolution of cooperative behaviour is widely existent in the biological organisms and social systems. In order to research the evolution of cooperation, some classical evolutionary games have been used, and Prisonersâ€™ Dilemma (PD) is one of the famous models. I study the evolutionary game in three-dimensional space and predict that it has the same performance as the game in two-dimensional space.
